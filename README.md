# Project Soopeli – Tech-Based Social Business Concept
2025<br><br>
**Tech-based social business concept** focused on empowering women in tech through mentorship, learning, and career growth.

This concept was developed during the **Social Business Academy**, a Finnish–Latvian training program focused on social entrepreneurship, and was pitched in **Tallinn, Estonia**.

My role focused on **Tech & Design**, including digital platform thinking, service structure, and supporting the pitch materials.



## Overview
Women face barriers in entering, staying, and growing in the tech industry, often due to:<br>

💜 Limited access to mentors, networks, and visible role models  
💜 Challenges related to career growth, retention, and re-entry  
💜 Lack of structured and accessible support systems  



## Key Concept Features
💜 Mentorship and networking opportunities  
💜 Learning resources and upskilling support  
💜 Career growth and re-entry guidance  
💜 Supportive and inclusive tech-focused community  



## Platform Logic & User Flow
High-level view of how the platform would work:

1️⃣ **Sign up & choose a path** (mentorship, career re-entry, or skill development)  
2️⃣ **Get matched** with mentors and relevant learning resources  
3️⃣ **Engage & learn** through sessions, events, and content  
4️⃣ **Progress** toward career growth and returning to tech
